CartMagnet monetizes your website by automatically making products that appear on your content, purchasable.

== Description ==
Cart Magnet™ is a widget for content websites that automatically makes products purchasable directly from the content, without redirecting website visitors outside. The outcome is a frictionless, native purchase experience that not only converts better, but also doesn’t consume traffic while doing so.
